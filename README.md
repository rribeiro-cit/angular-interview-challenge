# Angular Interview Challenge

## Angular Tic Tac Toe

We provided some simple Angular template code. Your goal is to create a functioning Tic Tac Toe game. 

## Instructions

It should work the following way: 

- The first player to go places an X anywhere on the board, and then the next player will be able to place an O, and it continues alternating like this every turn. 

- You should also implement a function to determine if any player won by getting 3 X's or O's in a row. If there is a winner, display a message at the top. If nobody wins, then do not display any message. 

- Finally, you should also implement the reset function that resets the entire board. You should also not be able to override the other players move during the game.
